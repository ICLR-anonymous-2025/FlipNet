# FlipNet: Fourier Lipschitz Smooth Policy Network for Reinforcement Learning

### [Paper]
The anonymous full article is now visible in [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=maoBEh5rU7).

### [Code]
The code is now visible in [FlipNet.py](https://github.com/ICLR-anonymous-2025/FlipNet/blob/master/FlipNet.py), which is an executable Python file showing the core code of FlipNet. 
Users can easily replace your policy network by FlipNet based on code in [FlipNet.py](https://github.com/ICLR-anonymous-2025/FlipNet/blob/master/FlipNet.py).
